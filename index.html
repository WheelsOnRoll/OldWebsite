      <p>
        <span class="label">Wheels on Roll (WOR)</span> 
        is a service-oriented company with the prime aim to
        provide bicycles to the students on a rent for every semester or a similar
        stipulated time. The company allows the customers to own bicycles for their own
        personal use for a fixed amount of rent and deposit.
        The company goals are to simply utilize the presence of
        a demand for bicycles on rent and capitalize on it and at the same time commit to
        a social cause (under Green Initiative of Smart City plan for Mangalore) for
        helping the students. Renting the bicycles for every semester will allow the
        students who are comfortable on not increasing their asset during their stay in
        the college, to use them during the time period they are comfortable with and
        return them when they don’t have use for it, without the hassles of selling the
        cycle at a loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also one of the star points of this venture is the absence
        of a company/start-up with a similar idea in the country. This is the most ideal
        situation to nurture and develop a start-up with this idea.
        Talking about facts, we have received 150 responses
        according to our survey of people who are ready to rent a bicycle for a year as a
        start. And impressively all of these responses were recorded in a span of just
        fifteen days. Moreover for the pilot run we already have 8 cycles rolling
        successfully over the span of one month with 37.5% female users.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are delighted on announcing our successful effort in
        grabbing a place in STEP (College Start-up incubation centre) and also in getting a
        dedicated place in the campus to have our Working Yard, where in the
        maintenance related work for all the existing cycles in the campus is carried out
        under the banner WOR Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wheels on Roll is also planning to start its new
        technically sound initiative known as “Digitally Enabled Advanced Cycle Rental
        with advanced Locking Mechanism”, which has also attracted attention of IBM’s
        Vanitha Narayanan (IBM India Managing Director and Regional General Manager
        India/South Asia (ISA) ) and had been promised with Technical Aid from IBM. And
        we are aiming at summer 2017 for coming up with our first prototype.
